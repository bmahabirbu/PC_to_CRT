Use xrandr to see what label the VGA is something like vga1-1

Replace the vga in the crt script with the appropriate label.

If running fedora and you are using another monitor replace the label
with the appropriate hdmi

Run the script before connecting to the crt! It will take a few
tried to work especially on Fedora
